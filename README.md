# Digital Twin Simulation for Auto Manufacturing – Engine Assembly Line

This project demonstrates a **Python-based digital twin simulation** of an engine assembly line using the `simpy` discrete event simulation library and `matplotlib` for visualization. It was developed for a Business Process Reengineering (BPR) case study.

## Project Overview

The simulation models:
- **Engine assembly and testing processes**
- **Human and machine resource constraints**
- **Random equipment failures and repair workflows**
- **Time-series performance tracking**

It also includes a dashboard to visualize key metrics such as:
- Number of engines assembled over time
- Machine downtime
- Number of repairs

## Technologies Used

- Python 
- [`simpy`](https://simpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) – for process simulation
- `matplotlib` – for plotting the dashboard
